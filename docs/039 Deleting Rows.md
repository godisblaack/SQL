## üß† 1. Introduction

After learning how to **insert** and **update** data, the final essential data manipulation operation is **deleting records**.

In SQL, you can remove one or multiple rows from a table using the **`DELETE FROM`** statement.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Syntax of the `DELETE` Statement

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

| Clause                   | Description                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `DELETE FROM table_name` | Specifies which table to delete records from |
| `WHERE condition`        | (Optional) Specifies which rows to delete    |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:**
If you **omit the `WHERE` clause**, **all rows in the table** will be deleted.

---

## üß© 3. Example ‚Äì Deleting a Specific Record

Suppose we want to delete an invoice with an `invoice_id` of **1** from the `invoices` table.

```sql
USE sql_invoicing;

DELETE FROM
	invoices
WHERE
	invoice_id = 1;
```

‚úÖ This removes only the record with `invoice_id = 1`.
‚úÖ Other records remain untouched.

---

## üö® 4. Deleting Without a `WHERE` Clause (‚ö†Ô∏è Dangerous)

```sql
DELETE FROM invoices;
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **This deletes *every record* in the `invoices` table!**
Use it only when you truly intend to clear the entire table (e.g., before archiving or resetting test data).

üí° If you only want to remove all rows but keep the table structure, you can also use:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE invoices;
```

This is faster and resets any **auto-increment** values, but it cannot be rolled back in some databases.

---

## üß† 5. Using Subqueries in `DELETE` Statements

Just like in `UPDATE`, you can use a **subquery** to dynamically determine *which records to delete*.

For example, suppose you want to delete all invoices for a client named **‚ÄúMyworks.‚Äù**

### Step 1: Find the client

```sql
SELECT *
FROM clients
WHERE name = 'Myworks';
```

‚Üí Suppose it returns `client_id = 2`.

---

### Step 2: Use a subquery in the DELETE statement

Instead of hardcoding the ID, use the subquery directly:

```sql
DELETE FROM
	invoices
WHERE
	client_id = (
		SELECT
			client_id
		FROM
			clients
		WHERE
			name = 'Myworks'
	);
```

‚úÖ MySQL first executes the **subquery** to get the `client_id` for ‚ÄúMyworks.‚Äù
‚úÖ Then it deletes all invoices with that matching `client_id`.

---

## üîÅ 6. When Subquery Returns Multiple Results

If your subquery returns **multiple client IDs**, you should use the `IN` operator instead of `=`:

```sql
DELETE FROM
	invoices
WHERE
	client_id IN (
		SELECT
			client_id
		FROM
			clients
		WHERE
			state IN ('CA', 'NY')
	);
```

‚úÖ Deletes invoices for all clients located in **California** or **New York**.

## üß∞ 7. Best Practices for Safe Deletes

| Best Practice                      | Description                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Preview first**                  | Always run a `SELECT` query before deleting to see which records will be affected |
| **Use transactions**               | Wrap delete statements inside a transaction (`BEGIN` / `COMMIT`) for safety       |
| **Use `LIMIT` (if supported)**     | To delete in smaller batches when dealing with large tables                       |
| **Backup important data**          | Before running deletes in production environments                                 |
| **Avoid deleting without `WHERE`** | Unless you intentionally want to clear the entire table                           |

---

### ‚úÖ Example: Preview Before Deleting

Before executing a delete:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM invoices
WHERE client_id = (
	SELECT client_id
	FROM clients
	WHERE name = 'Myworks'
);
```

Once you verify the correct records, then execute your delete statement.

| Operation                         | Query                                                                                                 | Description                             |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Delete a specific record          | `DELETE FROM invoices WHERE invoice_id = 1;`                                                          | Deletes one record                      |
| Delete by subquery                | `DELETE FROM invoices WHERE client_id = (SELECT client_id FROM clients WHERE name='Myworks');`        | Deletes all invoices for the client     |
| Delete multiple clients‚Äô invoices | `DELETE FROM invoices WHERE client_id IN (SELECT client_id FROM clients WHERE state IN ('CA','NY'));` | Deletes invoices for multiple states    |
| Delete all data                   | `DELETE FROM invoices;`                                                                               | Deletes everything (use with caution)   |
| Truncate all data                 | `TRUNCATE TABLE invoices;`                                                                            | Deletes all data, resets auto-increment |

## üß† 9. Key Takeaways

* `DELETE FROM` is used to remove rows from a table.
* The `WHERE` clause filters which records get deleted.
* Subqueries can make deletions **dynamic and flexible**.
* Always **preview** before deleting and **avoid full deletes** unless necessary.
* Use `IN` when your subquery returns **multiple results**.

DELETE FROM
