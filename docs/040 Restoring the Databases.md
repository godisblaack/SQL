## Steps to Restore the Databases

1. **Open the SQL script**:

   * In MySQL Workbench, go to the **File** menu â†’ **Open SQL Script**.
   * Navigate to the folder where you saved the course SQL scripts.
     *(If you lost the folder, check the first section of the course for downloading the supplementary materials.)*

2. **Open the main script**:

   * Look for a file called `create_databases.sql`.
   * Open this file in the SQL editor.

3. **Execute the script**:

   * Click the **Execute** button (lightning bolt icon) or press **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run the entire script.
   * This will **recreate all the original databases**.

4. **Refresh the Navigator panel**:

   * In the left-hand panel, click the **refresh icon**.
   * The restored databases should now appear in the panel.

## âœ… Notes

* This will overwrite any changes you made in the exercises (new rows, updates, deletions).
* Restoring the databases ensures your environment matches the examples in future lessons.
